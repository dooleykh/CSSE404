Tapes:

default position of head is at the front of a variable

:env is basically as in PLC
:scope|:varname|value|:varname|value|:scope|:varname|value|:varname|value|:methodScope|

Class definitions are not stored - the compiler knows the relevant offsets

:objects contains all the existant objects
|:loc|address|:varname|value|:varname|value|:loc|address|:varname|value

:call contains the return addresses

:stack contains the arithmetic stack

:acc is where the result of an expression is put
:ra, :rb, :rc are intermediate values for turingBuilder

:args is the arguments to a procedure, :ret is the return value
(at the beginning of a procedure, we remove the arguments from :args and
put them in local environment)

TODO: we can drastically cut down on machine size by having the operators
go until a seperator (read - not 0 or 1) instead of having BitWidth states.
