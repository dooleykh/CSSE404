Tapes:

:env contains the current environment, much like its handled in the
typechecker, except that the names are not stored- the compiler remembers
the offset.
|:var|value|:var|value|:scope|:var|value|:var|value|

Class definitions are not stored - the compiler knows the relevant offsets
and 

:objects contains all the existant objects

:stack contains the callstack

:r0, :r1, :r2, :r3 are registers

:args is the arguements to a procedure, :ret is the return value
(at the beginning of a procedure, we remove the arguements from :args and
put them in local environment)
